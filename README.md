## Features

- **Stable Design**: Provides a sturdy base for the Pixdel display, ensuring it stays in place.
- **Customizable**: Can be resized or modified to suit specific needs.
- **Easy to Print**: Designed with 3D printing in mind for quick and easy fabrication.

## Files
- `stand.step`: The STEP file for the stand, which can be used with various CAD software for modifications or customizations.

## Requirements

- **3D Printer**: Any 3D printer that supports STL files (e.g., FDM, SLA).
- **Filament**: PLA, ABS, or any standard 3D printer filament.
- **CAD Software** (Optional): For modifying the design, you can use any CAD software that supports STEP files (e.g., FreeCAD, SolidWorks, Fusion 360).

## Instructions

1. Download the `neon-mount.step` file from this repository.
2. Load the file into your 3D printer software.
3. Print the stand using your preferred settings (standard PLA settings should work fine).
4. Once printed, assemble the Pixdel display onto the stand.

## Customization

You can modify the design using the `Neon_mount.step` file with your preferred CAD software. This allows you to adjust the stand’s dimensions, add features, or customize it for different setups.
